## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS utility classes

### What I learned

** CSS Utility classes ** - classes that are attached to the HTML as usual to do a specific thing.
Place the class on any element, as in the example below , the `flex` class is placed on any element that has to be centered and aligned using flex.

```CSS
.d-flex {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
